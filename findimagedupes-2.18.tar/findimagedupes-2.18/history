Switched from ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick.
From or before debian's 6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.11 version of the former,
the program developed a tendency to end up sitting in SIGSTOP.
The fingerprints created by Graphics::Magick seem hugely different
from those of Image::Magick but, if anything, matching is improved.
